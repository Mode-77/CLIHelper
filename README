CLIHelper 

Command-line Interface Helper Library


A simple library aimed at easing the pain of building command-line interfaces
and read-eval-print loops by handling argument capturing and user input.

CLIHelper works by simply scanning and lexing strings in-place with the help
of the C++ standard library.





At its core, CLIHelper is a small lexer and uses the concept of fields (which
can also be thought of as tokens)

A field is simply a substring that contains no spaces.

"plant"     a field
"Literary"  another field

When a field contains a space character, it becomes two fields.

"lucid imagination" a string containing two fields

Space characters only serve to separate fields; if one or more space characters
appear at either the beginning or end of a field, CLIHelper ignores them.

" snail  "
"snail"     these are the same to CLIHelper.

Non-alphanumeric characters are treated the same as alphanumeric characters.

"lucid + snail"     three distinct fields: "lucid" "+" "snail"

Using these concepts, you can parse user input strings like:

romdump -WHOLE -v --checksum

with no problem at all.
